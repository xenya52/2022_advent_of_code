# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Each year, Advent of Code provides a series of programming puzzles to solve during the month of December.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each folder contains the code and any additional resources used to solve that day's puzzle.

## Languages Used

- Rust

## How to Run

To run the solutions, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Navigate to the directory of the puzzle you want to run and use the following command:

```sh
cargo run

```
