# The idea
I'll separate the problem into multible parts:
1. Read file input and output a tuple, looks like  (usize, Vec<usize>)
2. Create a function that checks if the usize can reached with some calculations in the Vec<usize>
3. Iterrate trough the whole vector and check if the usize can be reached
= **Sum all the valid numbers / usizes**

# The rules
- Only use + and *
