# The idea
I'll separate the problem into multible parts:
1. Read file input and transform it into a 2D vector of chars
2. get_char_cooridnates_from_2D_vec
3. Find antenna pairs
4. Add antinodes to the 2D vector
5. Read the amount of antinodes as '#'
=**return the sum**

# Rules
  // Important ascii areas for this exercise
  // 48 -> 57 is equal to '0' -> '9'
  // 65 -> 90 is equal to 'A' -> 'Z'
  // 97 -> 122 is equal to 'a' -> 'z'
