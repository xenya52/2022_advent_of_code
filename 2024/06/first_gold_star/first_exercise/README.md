# The idea
I'll separate the problem into multible parts:
1. Read file input
2. Create a function that makes a 2D vector out of it
3. Iterrate trough the whole vector
= **Predict the path of the guard. How many distinct positions will the guard visit before leaving the mapped area?**

# The rules
directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]
