# The idea
I'll separate the problem into multible parts:
1. Resue the function to reat the input file
2. Use the to vector function
3. Iterate over the list of vectors with the index zero and check how often the vector is in the index one
4. Calculate how the the val from index zero times how often it accures in index one vector
= **Sum of the calculations**
